   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The June edition was suppose to take place at Bitlair in Amersfoort, but because Bitlair is moving and rebuilding the space the June edition will take place at Pixelbar in Rotterdam.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: It is Schiehaven 15C, not Schiehavenweg. Also some mapping options will show 15C as further down the road than it actually is. Google and Apple maps are correct.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re coming with public transportation: you can go to Tram stop Schiemond or Metro Station Delfshaven and then walk towards the harbor. We are behind the lit up building “De Kroon”, the Schiehaven street itself is quite dark at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To access the space you need to go up a set stairs, we sadly don’t have an elevator.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2023/06/28/Pixelbar-has-experienced-an-unexpected-issue</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, June 28th, at around 8:00 AM, we received distressing messages notifying us that the building housing Pixelbar was engulfed in flames. This building was not only a home to artists, furniture makers, and other builders, but it was also the heart of our community. The fire has had a devastating impact, reducing the entire structure to ashes. Fortunately, no injuries were reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incident has left our community in a state of shock, as we have suffered the irreplaceable loss of not just our physical space, but also all the equipment, tools, and projects we had  gathered over the course of 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/images/blog/fire.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fire&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the support has been heartwarming, but we still have a long way to go. We are determined to rebuild our hackerspace, keeping our mission alive. We are looking for equipment (supplies, tools, etc) and donations to rebuild our hackerspace to its former glory. Any contribution, no matter how big or small, will make a tremendous difference in our ability to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening there might be some participants left, so don’t hesitate to drop by if you don’t make it before 17:00. On our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixelbar.nl/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; you can see whether we’re open or closed. There is no need to sign up, just come by.

&lt;p&gt;Dit betekent dat Pixelbar volledig gesloten zal zijn voor iedereen, ingaand van 19-12-2021 05:00u tot nader bericht.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pixelbar and the current Corona Policy.</title>
   <link href="http://pixelbar.github.io/2021/11/28/Pixelbar-and-current-corona-policy/"/>
   <updated>2021-11-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2021/11/28/Pixelbar-and-current-corona-policy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Friday night (26-11-2021), like many, we watched the press conference in slight tension and what measures would be issued. The big question was if there will be a complete lockdown again – or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we as Pixelbar Hackerspace often want to read between the lines, we follow the measures as issued by the Dutch government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that Pixelbar will be closed from 17:00 to 5:00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We advice strongly to not going to the space! If you need to visit Pixelbar you can do this when you are a member or a friend of Pixelbar. You can only visit the space between 5:00 and 17:00 with a maximum of four people at a time! You can coördinate this via the Pixelbar Discord or IRC. The rules for visiting are the same like last weeks. Wear a mask and keep the 1.5 meter distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of emergency it is possible to consult with the board whether these rules can be deviated from. If you have any questions we can be reached via &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixelbar.nl/contact/&quot;&gt;https://pixelbar.nl/contact/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a complete list of rules visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.pixelbar.nl/index.php/Corona&quot;&gt;https://wiki.pixelbar.nl/index.php/Corona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nederlandse Tekst&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vrijdag avond (26-11-2021) hebben wij zoals velen in lichte spanning gekeken naar de persconferentie en welke maatregelen hierbij afgegeven zouden worden. Moeten wij weer volledig op slot of niet was hierin de grote vraag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ondanks dat wij als Pixelbar Hackerspace vaak tussen de regels heen willen lezen, volgen wij de maatregelen op zoals deze zijn afgegeven door de Nederlandse overheid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dit betekent dat Pixelbar van 17:00 tot en met 5:00 gesloten zal zijn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We adviseren met klem om niet naar Pixelbar te gaan! Wanneer je toch naar Pixelbar moet kan dit alleen als je een member of friend van Pixelbar bent. Je kan alleen tussen 5:00 en 17:00 langs komen met een maximum van vier personen tegelijk. Overleg in de Pixelbar Discord of IRC als je van plan bent om te gaan. De regels zijn hetzelfde als afgelopen weken. Draag een mondkapje en houd 1.5 meter afstand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bij noodgevallen kan er overlegd worden met het bestuur voor eventuele uitzonderingen. Mochten er vragen zijn dan zijn wij te bereiken via &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixelbar.nl/contact/&quot;&gt;https://pixelbar.nl/contact/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A refreshing shift in the board.</title>
   <link href="http://pixelbar.github.io/2021/10/16/A-Refreshing-Shift-In-The-Board/"/>
   <updated>2021-10-16T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2021/10/16/A-Refreshing-Shift-In-The-Board</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After Pixelbar was founded, David has always been the chairman of Pixelbar and passes the baton to mc.fly. In addition to stopping David, EchteTim stopped his duties within the board a while back. This created 2 vacancies within the board which were completed by Tucje and Nosfaratuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David will step down as chairman of Pixelbar on November 1, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chairman: mc.fly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secretary: Nosfaratuss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Treasurer: Eddie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General board member: Miep&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General board member: Tucje&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David has been involved since the start of Pixelbar and the founding of the foundation and has served as its chairman ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, David and Miep gave shape to the establishment of Pixelbar and thereby also laid the first planks within the Keilewerf. From the board we would like to thank David for his efforts since the beginning of time. &lt;em&gt;insert applause&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nederlandse Tekst&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadat Pixelbar is opgericht is David altijd de voorzitter geweest van Pixelbar en geeft hij het stokje door aan mc.fly. Naast het stoppen van David is een tijdje terug EchteTim gestopt met zijn taken binnen het bestuur. Hiermee ontstonden er 2 open plekken binnen het bestuur welke aangevuld zijn door Tucje en Nosfaratuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David stopt per 1 november 2021 als voorzitter van Pixelbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiermee komt het bestuur er als volgt uit te zien;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Voorzitter: mc.fly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secretaris: Nosfaratuss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Penningmeester: Eddie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Algemeen bestuurslid: Miep&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Algemeen bestuurslid: Tucje&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David is vanaf het begin betrokken geweest bij Pixelbar en de oprichting van de stichting en sindsdien ook de rol als voorzitter vervult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015 heeft David samen met Miep vorm gegeven aan de oprichting van Pixelbar en hiermee ook de eerste planken gelegd binnen de Keilewerf. Vanuit het bestuur willen wij David bedanken voor zijn inzet sinds het begin der tijden. &lt;em&gt;insert applaus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pixelbar moves to online-only for now</title>
   <link href="http://pixelbar.github.io/2020/11/06/Pixelbar-Goes-Online-Only/"/>
   <updated>2020-11-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2020/11/06/Pixelbar-Goes-Online-Only</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear visitor,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch government announced new regulations due to the situation regarding COVID-19. One of the new regulations will be the closing of club houses and other locations for public gatherings, including hackerspaces. Therefore, we have no other choice than to go back to our chairs at home and take our activities back another way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore meet online (for now). You can find the Pixelbar Discord Server at &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/b4Dcx8f&quot;&gt;https://discord.gg/b4Dcx8f&lt;/a&gt;, We also bridged this to IRC #pixelbar on smurfnet and even Slack is used (check website for howto)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In here we will discuss if there is a demand for a (regular) wednesday / saturday video conference meeting. These meetings will take place at &lt;a href=&quot;https://jitsi.milliways.info/pixelbar&quot;&gt;The Pixelbar Jitsi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join our Discord, IRC channel or Slack server and meet us there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nederlandse Tekst&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beste bezoeker,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Nederlandse overheid heeft nieuwe maatregelen aangekondigd met betrekking tot COVID-19. Eén van de maatregelen betreft de sluiting van clubhuizen en andere locaties waar mensen samenkomen, een hackerspace valt daar ook onder. We hebben geen andere keus om terug te gaan naar onze stoel thuis en onze activiteiten op een alternatieve manier voort te zetten.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pixelbar re-opening</title>
   <link href="http://pixelbar.github.io/2020/06/17/Pixelbar-Re-Opening/"/>
   <updated>2020-06-17T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2020/06/17/Pixelbar-Re-Opening</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the awesome BBQ we had on 13-June with our participants, we took a moment to prepare for reopening Pixelbar. The entire area was cleaned, which was no luxery after beeing closed for 2.5 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we have started on deviding the hacking-desks downstairs with plastic foil. While the Proof of Concept worked, but also showed to be a lot of work, we are awaiting deliveries for the final construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight, 19th of June 2020, we want to reopen for a small group of people. We have set the limit of this evening to 5 people. Please talk to eachother in the chat to reserve your spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be desinfectants for your hands, and cleaning material for the desks, doorknobs etc. We do kindly request you to wash or desinfect your hands when entering the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please also keep the generic rules set by the Government and the RIVM in mind. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/nederlandse-maatregelen-tegen-het-coronavirus/gezondheidsadviezen&quot;&gt;Current regulations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nederlandse Tekst&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadat we afgelopen Zaterdag (13-Juni) een erg gezellige bbq gehad hebben met onze deelnemers, hebben we het moment aangepakt om de voorbereidingen te treffen voor het her-openen van Pixelbar. Wat begon als een wild idee op de chat, liep uit in een complete schoonmaak van de space, Waarbij keuken, tafels beneden en de lounge schoongemaakt zijn na 2,5 maand van gesloten zijn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tevens is er een begin gemaakt aan het scheiden van onze hacking-bureaus beneden. Een tijdelijke voorziening met folie is bedacht, en de materialen om dit af te maken zijn besteld.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanavond, 19 Juni 2020 willen we voor het eerst weer open gaan. Dit doen we voor maximaal 5 mensen. Overleg dus even via de chat wie er gaat. Als vanavond bevalt, gaan we kijken of we kunnen opschalen. Dit bepalen we echter pas na deze eerste testavond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Er zijn ontsmettingsmiddelen aanwezig voor de handen, en reinigingsmiddelen voor de tafels, deurklinken enz. Het verzoek is dan ook om je handen goed te wassen bij binnenkomst, of om deze te ontsmetten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Houdt A.u.b. ook rekening met geldende regelgeving van de overheid en het RIVM. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/nederlandse-maatregelen-tegen-het-coronavirus/gezondheidsadviezen&quot;&gt;Actuele regelgeving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pixelbar re-opening and a BBQ</title>
   <link href="http://pixelbar.github.io/2020/06/07/Pixelbar-Re-Opening-and-BBQ/"/>
   <updated>2020-06-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2020/06/07/Pixelbar-Re-Opening-and-BBQ</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since there was news from us since the space was temporarily closed. We are already working hard on plans to make the space Corona Proof as possible and it looks like we can open again soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To thank everyone for the patience and support of the past few months, we invite all the Pixelbar participants for a barbecue! &lt;strong&gt;Saturday, June 13, 2020 at 4:00 PM&lt;/strong&gt; we will have a barbecue outside on the Keilewerf terrain, which will be provided by the Pixelbar board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are a number of rules that we have drawn up to ensure that the barbecue runs as safely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The barbecue is only for participants (so also friends of the space) of Hackerspace Pixelbar, if you are not a participant or friend, we request you not to come.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of the 1.5 meters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gloves are used during food preparation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disinfectant will be available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pixelbar is not open yet, so stay outside of Pixelbar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toilets inside are open&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have health problems related to corona, stay at home. Look at the website of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19&quot;&gt;RIVM&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the board will enter the space to get items needed for the barbecue.
Normally we appreciate all help during a barbecue, but we ask everyone to come no earlier than 16:00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can register via the wiki at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.pixelbar.nl/index.php/Projects:2020:Participants_BBQ&quot;&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt; - If you cannot login yet, ask someone who can login to register you for this bbq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you all and that it will be a pleasant evening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nederlandse Tekst&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Het is weer even geleden dat wij iets van ons hebben laten horen sinds de space tijdelijk is afgesloten. Er wordt al hard gewerkt aan plannen om de space zo Corona Proof mogelijk in te richten en het ziet er naar uit dat we snel weer open kunnen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Om iedereen te bedanken voor het geduld en de steun van de afgelopen maanden nodigen wij alle deelnemers van Pixelbar uit voor een barbecue! &lt;strong&gt;Zaterdag 13 juni 2020 om 16:00&lt;/strong&gt; zullen wij buiten op het Keilewerf terrein een barbecue houden welke verzorgd word door het bestuur van Pixelbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wel zijn er een aantal regels welke wij hebben opgesteld om de barbecue zo veilig mogelijk te laten verlopen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;De barbecue is alleen voor deelnemers (dus ook voor friends of the space) van Hackerspace Pixelbar, ben je geen deelnemer of friend dan verzoeken wij je om niet te komen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let op de 1.5 meter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tijdens de bereiding van het eten word er gebruik gemaakt van handschoenen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Er zal desinfectans beschikbaar zijn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pixelbar is nog niet open, ga dan ook niet de space in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toiletten binnen zijn open&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heb je gezondheidsklachten gerelateerd aan corona blijf dan thuis. Meer informatie op de website van het &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19&quot;&gt;RIVM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alleen het bestuur zal de space betreden om spullen te halen welke nodig zijn voor de barbecue. 
Normaliter waarderen we alle hulp tijdens een barbecue, echter vragen we een ieder om niet eerder dan 16:00 te komen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aanmelden kan via de &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.pixelbar.nl/index.php/Projects:2020:Participants_BBQ&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; - Kun je nog niet inloggen op de wiki, vraag dan iemand anders je even in te schrijven voor de barbeque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hopen jullie allemaal te zien en dat het een gezellige avond word!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The 29th of November it is a party once again! Just like last year, we will be celebrating Sint Pannekoek with everybody starting &lt;strong&gt;at 19:00&lt;/strong&gt;, with lots and lots of pancakes and friends! Please give us a heads up if you like to join (so we can go grocerie shopping only once :)) on to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.pixelbar.nl&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; or IRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we baked pancakes for about 4 hours, Everyone really enjoyed eating pancakes and placing pancakes over their heads. Sounds strange doesn’t it? Well, it’s a very old Rotterdam tradition and we’d like to celebrate it by basically eating lots of pancakes. Yep. It’s the best tradition there is. And nobody will ever change our tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/images/pancakes.png&quot; alt=&quot;sketch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: help baking pancakes is very welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while, but we’re back! Our space had some renovation, which now allows us to do a workshop downstairs and a freeform upstairs if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;Workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of creating a traditional API using REST (a way to create a webserver and serve data to a website), we’ll be looking at GraphQL. This is a technology that has been picked up by larger companies, which allows you to do actual quering of your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry if you didn’t really get that! We’ll be able to help everyone out, whether you’re a beginning with programming or somebody that already start doing NodeJS development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;freeform&quot;&gt;Freeform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to show of your project? Or need help with your project? It doesn’t need to be related to GraphQL - but that would be nice. Talk, learn and do projects with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the site for more information: &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodeschool.io/rotterdam/&quot;&gt;nodeschool.io/rotterdam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our members (Miep) is even having a talk about decryption of ssl traffic. You could say, Pixelbar is surely to be found at the event!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will we see you there? We’ll bring stickers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information on the event website : &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerhotel.nl&quot;&gt;HackerHotel.nl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year will be all about hacking, exploring and creating new stuff! Do you want to find out more about that really old ZX Spectrum or do you really want to learn Rust, C#, NodeJS or any other programming language ? That’s what we’re about! We really support learning new things! And what better time to start hacking then with the beginning of a new year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we see you around this year ? We’re looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>CryptoParty at Worm (12/12)</title>
   <link href="http://pixelbar.github.io/2017/11/30/worm-cryptoparty/"/>
   <updated>2017-11-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2017/11/30/worm-cryptoparty</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nowadays everyone is concerned about their privacy, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Arguing that you don’t care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Edward Snowden&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we’d like to think so. Therefor we’re going to take matters into our own hands during this awesome CryptoParty! Learn, talk and inspire each other how to be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cryptoparty.in&quot;&gt;CryptoParty&lt;/a&gt; you can learn how to encrypt your emails and messages, how to browse anonymously and ask all the questions you have about privacy and security. Although talking about security is an option, a CryptoParty makes much more sense if you can install some security tools and learn how to use them, so bring a laptop or a smartphone to the event!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event is free and open for everyone, especially for those without prior knowledge of cybersecurity. As we need to know how many people will join, we ask you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://worm.stager.nl/web/tickets/171834&quot;&gt;please sign up here&lt;/a&gt;, using any nickname you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At 19:00 our friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://shiromarieke.github.io/&quot;&gt;Marie&lt;/a&gt; will take the lead and help everyone be more secure with a group of volunteers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is hosted at &lt;a href=&quot;https://worm.org/&quot;&gt;Worm&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktalk.nl&quot;&gt;Hacktalk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://roselabs.nl/about/&quot;&gt;Rotterdam Security Labs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also slightly changed the format, so it’s an all new NodeSchool and therefor we’re going to do something special, namely: hardware hacking. Using JavaScript and NodeJS we’re going to start out doing some hardware challenges. It’ll be heavily inspired by Nodebots. So please join us and let’s hack something cool together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s open to everyone, it doesn’t matter if you don’t have any experience coding and/or with hardware. All you need to do is stop by and have a look. If you want to join the focussed session however, please signup and show up for the one at 12:00 or 15:00 and please bring a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

An event that is all about people that like to tinker and play around with electronics, which can be as simple as blinking a LED with an Arduino or as complicated as building autonomous robots to explore the universe. While the focus will be on hardware, software will play an important role as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tickets.pixelbar.nl/ej/1/&quot;&gt;Pixelbar Ticketshop&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to participate in the Arduino workshop by Mitch Altman or the SMD workshop by Klimnt you can reserve your spot and reserve the required kits of components in the shop as well. Please note, there are limited component kits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electron Junction is the first day-long event organized by Pixelbar Rotterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Wednesday, on Feb 22th at 8pm&lt;/strong&gt; our hackerspace will welcome a special guest. Namely: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ncilla&quot;&gt;Ancilla van de Leest&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tk2017.piratenpartij.nl/&quot;&gt;Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt; of The Netherlands. The reason why she is stopping by is not necessarily because she is from Rotterdam and visits hackerpaces regularly (it’s a first for our space though). No, instead she will visit us to talk about her party and the upcoming Dutch parliamentary elections, which are happening next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;padding-bottom: 15px;&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GbjUe-FYg7s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although you might or might not share the same political views, everyone is welcome and our space is open for new discussions. So if you’re interested in Dutch politics, the Pirate Party, net neutrality, privacy topics or Ancilla in general - come visit us this Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last time we had a lot fun building a chatbot with JavaScript in NodeJS! To continue on this journey of learning how to work with event based programming, we figured it was time to dive into websockets. Although it might be very similar to building a chatbot, we think it can be either a good lesson for new people or a fun challenge for the intermediate developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re hosting the first NodeSchool in Rotterdam. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodeschool.io/&quot;&gt;NodeSchool&lt;/a&gt; are hosted open source workshops that teach web software skills. And best of all… they’re free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; is a popular, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing a diverse variety of tools and applications. This first edition will be focussing on the basics of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript&quot;&gt;JavaScript (ES6)&lt;/a&gt; with Node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see whether people in Rotterdam are interested to learn writing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re planning to organise this every month. The first edition is already full, but when you signup on meetup.com, you’ll be notified when the next one is announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/nodeschool-rotterdam/events/233949133&quot;&gt;Join us on meetup.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>We have to blog more!</title>
   <link href="http://pixelbar.github.io/2016/09/06/we-have-to-blog-more/"/>

   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2016/09/06/we-have-to-blog-more</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-holidays-are-over&quot;&gt;The holidays are over!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our last post we mentioned some of our members went to allsort of different camps. From Gamer-related camps to Hacker camps. Our participants are very diverse!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer some of our members decided on traveling to the United Kingdom for EMF Camp, against all expectations the weather was pretty nice and the camp was great. After returning from EMF Camp mc.fly and cookingroffa decided to go directly to CCC Camp in Germany. At the same moment miep, david, dennus, pim and tucje travelled to Limburg in the Netherlands to visit CampZone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the writer of this article was amongst the “CampZone” visitors i will not have very much to tell about EMF and CCC Camp :(, We might add an update later!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CampZone, a gamer camp held for the 16th time in Kronenberg we have met a lot of awesome people. We also noticed the general idea of “Gaming” at a camp like this is just for a small part of the visitors. Others are just here to put raw meat on the bbq or even perform some cosplay acts. Fortunatly we noticed in the last couple of years there was a great interest in hacking, not just the it-hacking part but also some electronics came by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a good hacker, you should at least destro,.. expiriment when you are somewhere. This CampZone we have found out, Inflateble bed pumps work under water, providing us with a nice fountain which tickled. After measuring we noticed there was around 80V AC flowing through us. And, our coffeemachine pump stopped working. This offcourse was an immediate reason to do some expirimenting. this time we just overclocked the poor 12V-DC pump to a comfortable 36V-DC. We managed to get the thing going again for some short time ( but the water got up very high ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had also brought lots of tinkering stuffs, which gave us the possibility to do an upgrade to the “beer-counter”, add an external antenne to a drone controller and we even got started with some SDR stuff. David found out cheap batteries sucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side project, one of out awesome friends Trouble came up with the idea of a festival-newspaper called “de PixelPaper”. An idea that got into everyones head. 5 editions were made, and they are still online today! please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixelpaper.nl&quot;&gt;pixelpaper.nl&lt;/a&gt; where you can read all editions, even the ones with the real-life capture the flag storyline! Thanks Trouble!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to visit us during our weekly meetups on Wednesdays. Please check our website for the current spacestate, follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/pixelbar010&quot;&gt;@pixelbar010&lt;/a&gt; on twitter or subscribe to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pushover.net/subscribe/PixelbarSpacestate-gbQgUDCwh2Yi8L5&quot;&gt;Pushover&lt;/a&gt; group to get Push messages when we are open!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-5-hacking-confirmed&quot;&gt;Update #5 Hacking confirmed!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since our last post, pretty much everything has changed. At least, as far as it concerns our hacking/building ratio. We even had some time to do some hacking, tinkering and soldering, Nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walls downstairs are allmost completely done, so we continued upstairs. After some carefull planning to get the forklift in the smallest spaces we allmost made it to the ceiling. The last part of the walls upstairs will be left open for now, leaving some space for a “led-enabled” rooftop. Mc.fly thought of a very nice idea which would completely cover up the entire ceiling, making sure none of the industrial ceiling will be visible anymore. Offcourse we will update you with pic’s when it is done. We have also installed lockers for our participants to leave their projects and personal tools in the hackerspace. Every full member will get a locker until they are all gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 27th of June, we had a small hacking day. Just a day without hammers, drills and screws. We started with some nice projects. Pim and David even started building some nice electronic kits. Miep was doing weird stuff with a SDR dongle and a raspberrypi 3 and Cookingroffa created her own temperature regulator for some awesome food hacking tools. Needless to say, the day was a great success and the start of the “Yay! we’re getting there” feeling in and around the space.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next wednesday will be a busy evening, since it is getting very close to the holidays. If you are around and want to get a nice peek inside Pixelbar, we’ll be there around 19:00. After this week, some of our members will attend summercamps and events like EMF-Camp and CampZone. Will we see you there ? Most of our members who attend CampZone will bring loads of tinkering stuffs with them. We will update you if awesome projects are created, after the holidays we will try to bring most of the projects to Pixelbar so they are visible for everyone in real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the holidays there is a small possibility nobody attends Pixelbar during our weekly meetups on Wednesdays. Please check our website for the current spacestate, follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitter.com/pixelbar010&quot;&gt;@pixelbar010&lt;/a&gt; on twitter or subscribe to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://pushover.net/subscribe/PixelbarSpacestate-gbQgUDCwh2Yi8L5&quot;&gt;Pushover&lt;/a&gt; group to get Push messages when we are open!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Buildlog new space part 4</title>
   <link href="http://pixelbar.github.io/2016/05/21/buildlog-new-space-part-4/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-21T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2016/05/21/buildlog-new-space-part-4</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-4-the-floor-is-done-were-getting-somewhere&quot;&gt;Update #4 The floor is done, We’re getting somewhere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week a lot of work was done on the installation of our floor by Dennus, Teq, Gollum, Jchn, Tucje and Pim. We can safely say, the floor is now finished. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also created a front wall. The wall even includes a door with a lock. Miep and Pim have learned how to (not) install a door, and eventually they managed to create a way of closing off our hackerspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This buildlog is not as big as the buildlogs before, this has to do with the fact that we really want to continue our work on the hackerspace!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-build-meetup&quot;&gt;Next build meetup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Wednesday ( 25th of May ) we will be back at Pixelbar to continue our work. Miep and Pim will continue working on the big door in the front of the hackerspace, Tucje and Dennus will continue working on the closet and some of our members will start working on the walls upstairs. If you are around, feel free to drop by. ( but note, we might ask you to help us ;) ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-want-more-info&quot;&gt;I want more info&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to know all about our new hackerspace ? Please look over &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.pixelbar.nl/index.php/Projects:2016:New_Hackerspace&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send us advice or, even more important help us building the new space. We are nowhere without help from our participants and our friends. We try to keep the Wiki as up-to-date as possible. When we have final dates for building the construction we will also send out an email to our mailinglist which you can join &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixelbar.nl/joinlist/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Buildlog new space part 3</title>
   <link href="http://pixelbar.github.io/2016/05/08/buildlog-new-space-part-3/"/>
   <updated>2016-05-08T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2016/05/08/buildlog-new-space-part-3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-3-the-floor-is-lava--no-it-aint-but-hey-it-sounds-awesome-&quot;&gt;Update #3 The floor is lava! ( no it aint, but hey it sounds awesome! )&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last couple of days we have used our time wisely! on Kingsday we were placing and creating walls and frames on the first floor, Then when we met again on wednesday we prepared some more and had an awesome (pixel-)barbeque, made more idea’s an thought of constructions. Thursday was a national holiday in the netherlands, because it was “bevrijdingsdag” or Liberation Day. Since we all had a day off from work we decided to do some more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13122969_571072729733789_5276169715201036582_o.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13130840_571072663067129_7682278559961239185_o.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-are-we-now&quot;&gt;Where are we now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last couple of days were ideal to work in the space, a lot had to be done and a lot of help was received from participants and friends. As of now we can say, the floor is getting somewhere. One of our participants, Pim made load calculations of what the floor should, could and also could not handle. This resulted in some very nice pictures and a clear view of where to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday Pim and Miep joined forces and started working on the frame to support our false floor. We had decided on creating a false floor because of the very cold concrete in our space. This would be very welcome in the summer, but it would also be way too cold in the winter to work on your projects. As you will see in the pictures, we covered almost 1/3th of the space with the frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David and Juerd continued working on the frames which were needed to create the walls upstairs. In the short amount of time, all the frames were fixed, Thanks Juerd!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Dennus had made a door for our closet. which looks like a nice piece of craftmanship. If you would ever need a door, just give a call. He might be in town to help you out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can say after the last couple of days, the Pixelbar participants rock! much work is done, and we now know the rest of the work will also be done by creative, technical and driven people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, 8Th of May, some of our participants are in the hackerspace again. If you want to help us building our( and maybe even your ) new hackerspace. You are very welcome! Just check our site, twitter or chat for the “Pixelbar is Open!” messages. Since last friday the spacestate is working correctly again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;complimentary-videos&quot;&gt;Complimentary Videos&lt;/h3&gt;

   <updated>2016-04-28T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2016/04/28/buildlog-new-space-part-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, we can start each post with a standard “we’re back again” however we though it was a better idea to show you what we did so-far. On Kingsday 2016 we came together with some of our members to start working on the walls of the new hackerspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-agenda&quot;&gt;Our Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started the day getting some wood, After we brought the new materials back to the space we started working on a frame for one of the walls. At noon, we had finished our first wall frame. Later during the day we made another frame. At least it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13130854_567355333438862_8943574628870175768_o.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;project-wifi&quot;&gt;Project WiFi&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Keilewerf, we thought of an central WiFi network infrastructure. The “old” WiFi network was only working in the central kitchen. Unfortunately the reach was not enough for all of the awesome neighbours we have at the Keilewerf. Dennus and Miep started working on the new WiFi environment on Kingsday. At the end of the evening everything worked! We had places 1 small rack as distribution and 5 Accesspoints were placed at this moment, 2 more are to be placed in Pixelbar itself. For complete awesomeness we have added 2 racks to our hackerspace ( which were sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nifhack.nl&quot;&gt;nifhack&lt;/a&gt; ). We will distribute the network of our hackerspace centrally via these racks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/s960x960/13063050_567355376772191_7661748750779694234_o.jpg&quot; width=&quot;350px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2016-04-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2016/04/05/buildlog-new-space-and-hackerhotel</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here we are again! Pixelbar, a hackerspace without a space. At least, for now. Since the opening where we announced the upcoming move of the physical location of the space we did a lot of work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a pile of idea’s, lots of very enthousiastic participants and even more important a location within the Keilewerf where our new hackerspace would come. Since Februari we have made plans for the new hackerspace. Last week we took a major step forward, the mezzanine was finally placed. Now it’s far more visible what the size of the new Pixelbar space will be. We can tell you, we were very pleased with the result so far. Today we will be ordering the nescesarry build materials for the walls, When it arrives our awesome neighbour Sil will help us out with the construction of the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-project&quot;&gt;The project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since building your own hackerspace looks like a project we decided to start a wiki article on it which you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.pixelbar.nl/index.php/Projects:2016:New_Hackerspace&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send us advice or, even more important help us building the new space. We are nowhere without help from our participants and our friends. We try to keep the Wiki as up-to-date as possible. When we have final dates for building the construction we will also send out an email to our mailinglist which you can join &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pixelbar.nl/joinlist/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hackerhotel&quot;&gt;Hackerhotel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not all we have done, Five of our members also attended &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackerhotel.nl&quot;&gt;HackerHotel&lt;/a&gt; last week, A hacker conference in the Netherlands. We even had a new participant register on the event. Apart from attending lots of interesting (tech) talks we also talked a lot about Pixelbar. We wanted to make sure the name would be in everyone’s head. Needless to say, it worked! Lots of participants from other hackerspace, students and other people were really interested in Pixelbar. We were even offered extra help on building the new hackerspace!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see some of the talks which were given on Hackerhotel, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackerhotel.sigio.nl/2016/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; link.&lt;/p&gt;

This has really kickstarted the current space. We’ve also received lots of ideas and input on how we could create and arrange everything in the new (upcoming) space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://keilefest.nl&quot;&gt;Keilefest&lt;/a&gt; did a great job on the festival, with artists like &lt;a href=&quot;http://wldrf.nl/&quot;&gt;WLDRF&lt;/a&gt; and the great food and beverages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all, thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/brenno&quot;&gt;Brenno&lt;/a&gt; for giving a presentation and explaining the world about hackerspaces (Dutch):&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2016-01-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://pixelbar.github.io/2016/01/11/funded</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, we made a proposal for funding at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.citylab010.nl/plannen/hackerspaceinrotterdam&quot;&gt;CityLab 010&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch). Furthermore, we gave a pitch to the city council and other related parties to inform them about the situation in Rotterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to announce that the Rotterdam government has passed this grant towards our cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why a hackerspace would reach out to the government in the first place. As a hackerspace we have certain goals we’d like to make happen sooner than later. This oppertunity has brought us closer to our goals without sacraficing the membership fee of our members, which makes us more flexible to make decisions and basically gives us a better runway for the first year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still have questions? Just &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:bestuur@pixelbar.nl&quot;&gt;reach out&lt;/a&gt; to us.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting 2016, Rotterdam will officially have a proper hackerspace: Pixelbar. We’ve been a small community and are prepping a workspace in &lt;a href=&quot;http://stadshavensrotterdam.nl/deelgebieden/merwe-vierhavens/&quot;&gt;M4H&lt;/a&gt;. It’s time to meet, socialize and collaborate in 010. Bring your knowledge and ideas about computers, machinery, tech, science, digital art and let’s get this party started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-we-offer&quot;&gt;What do we offer?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to our workspace, we bring a few other things to the table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Awesome members that would like to meet you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work with you on projects and explain how we’ve build a few of our own on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.pixelbar.nl/index.php/Main_Page&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn you more through e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;/workshops&quot;&gt;workshops&lt;/a&gt; and make them accessible for anyone that wants to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give you insight on our code using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pixelbar&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit (local and international) hackathons and other hackerspaces together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;strong&gt;☰&lt;/strong&gt; to see more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-i-do&quot;&gt;What can I do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re already familiar with the hackerspace community, or maybe you’re not. You might have heard of us through a friend, or about us on the news. Either way, the thing you should know is hackers come in many forms: from food- to IKEA-hacking and obviously computer-hacking too. Everything is possible, as long as you share that information - you’re a hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, you’re welcome to join us by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/register&quot;&gt;Become a member of the space and start hacking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/register&quot;&gt;Become a friend of the space to support our cause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a great - hacking -  year!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
