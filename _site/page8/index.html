    <h3 id="the-holidays-are-over">The holidays are over!</h3>

<p>In our last post we mentioned some of our members went to allsort of different camps. From Gamer-related camps to Hacker camps. Our participants are very diverse!</p>

<p>This summer some of our members decided on traveling to the United Kingdom for EMF Camp, against all expectations the weather was pretty nice and the camp was great. After returning from EMF Camp mc.fly and cookingroffa decided to go directly to CCC Camp in Germany. At the same moment miep, david, dennus, pim and tucje travelled to Limburg in the Netherlands to visit CampZone.</p>

<p>Because the writer of this article was amongst the “CampZone” visitors i will not have very much to tell about EMF and CCC Camp :(, We might add an update later!</p>

<p>At CampZone, a gamer camp held for the 16th time in Kronenberg we have met a lot of awesome people. We also noticed the general idea of “Gaming” at a camp like this is just for a small part of the visitors. Others are just here to put raw meat on the bbq or even perform some cosplay acts. Fortunatly we noticed in the last couple of years there was a great interest in hacking, not just the it-hacking part but also some electronics came by.</p>

<p>As a good hacker, you should at least destro,.. expiriment when you are somewhere. This CampZone we have found out, Inflateble bed pumps work under water, providing us with a nice fountain which tickled. After measuring we noticed there was around 80V AC flowing through us. And, our coffeemachine pump stopped working. This offcourse was an immediate reason to do some expirimenting. this time we just overclocked the poor 12V-DC pump to a comfortable 36V-DC. We managed to get the thing going again for some short time ( but the water got up very high ).</p>

<p>We had also brought lots of tinkering stuffs, which gave us the possibility to do an upgrade to the “beer-counter”, add an external antenne to a drone controller and we even got started with some SDR stuff. David found out cheap batteries sucked.</p>

<p>As a side project, one of out awesome friends Trouble came up with the idea of a festival-newspaper called “de PixelPaper”. An idea that got into everyones head. 5 editions were made, and they are still online today! please visit <a href="http://www.pixelpaper.nl">pixelpaper.nl</a> where you can read all editions, even the ones with the real-life capture the flag storyline! Thanks Trouble!</p>

<p>If you want to visit us during our weekly meetups on Wednesdays. Please check our website for the current spacestate, follow <a href="https://www.twitter.com/pixelbar010">@pixelbar010</a> on twitter or subscribe to our <a href="https://pushover.net/subscribe/PixelbarSpacestate-gbQgUDCwh2Yi8L5">Pushover</a> group to get Push messages when we are open!</p>

    <h3 id="update-5-hacking-confirmed">Update #5 Hacking confirmed!</h3>

<p>Since our last post, pretty much everything has changed. At least, as far as it concerns our hacking/building ratio. We even had some time to do some hacking, tinkering and soldering, Nice!</p>

<p>The walls downstairs are allmost completely done, so we continued upstairs. After some carefull planning to get the forklift in the smallest spaces we allmost made it to the ceiling. The last part of the walls upstairs will be left open for now, leaving some space for a “led-enabled” rooftop. Mc.fly thought of a very nice idea which would completely cover up the entire ceiling, making sure none of the industrial ceiling will be visible anymore. Offcourse we will update you with pic’s when it is done. We have also installed lockers for our participants to leave their projects and personal tools in the hackerspace. Every full member will get a locker until they are all gone.</p>

<p>At the 27th of June, we had a small hacking day. Just a day without hammers, drills and screws. We started with some nice projects. Pim and David even started building some nice electronic kits. Miep was doing weird stuff with a SDR dongle and a raspberrypi 3 and Cookingroffa created her own temperature regulator for some awesome food hacking tools. Needless to say, the day was a great success and the start of the “Yay! we’re getting there” feeling in and around the space.</p>

<p>Next wednesday will be a busy evening, since it is getting very close to the holidays. If you are around and want to get a nice peek inside Pixelbar, we’ll be there around 19:00. After this week, some of our members will attend summercamps and events like EMF-Camp and CampZone. Will we see you there ? Most of our members who attend CampZone will bring loads of tinkering stuffs with them. We will update you if awesome projects are created, after the holidays we will try to bring most of the projects to Pixelbar so they are visible for everyone in real life.</p>

<p>Because of the holidays there is a small possibility nobody attends Pixelbar during our weekly meetups on Wednesdays.

    <h3 id="update-4-the-floor-is-done-were-getting-somewhere">Update #4 The floor is done, We’re getting somewhere</h3>

<p>Last week a lot of work was done on the installation of our floor by Dennus, Teq, Gollum, Jchn, Tucje and Pim. We can safely say, the floor is now finished. Yay!</p>

<p>We also created a front wall. The wall even includes a door with a lock. Miep and Pim have learned how to (not) install a door, and eventually they managed to create a way of closing off our hackerspace.</p>

<p>This buildlog is not as big as the buildlogs before, this has to do with the fact that we really want to continue our work on the hackerspace!</p>

<h3 id="next-build-meetup">Next build meetup</h3>

<p>Next Wednesday ( 25th of May ) we will be back at Pixelbar to continue our work. Miep and Pim will continue working on the big door in the front of the hackerspace, Tucje and Dennus will continue working on the closet and some of our members will start working on the walls upstairs. If you are around, feel free to drop by. ( but note, we might ask you to help us ;) ).</p>

<p>Feel free to send us advice or, even more important help us building the new space. We are nowhere without help from our participants and our friends. We try to keep the Wiki as up-to-date as possible.

<p>The last couple of days we have used our time wisely! on Kingsday we were placing and creating walls and frames on the first floor, Then when we met again on wednesday we prepared some more and had an awesome (pixel-)barbeque, made more idea’s an thought of constructions. Thursday was a national holiday in the netherlands, because it was “bevrijdingsdag” or Liberation Day. Since we all had a day off from work we decided to do some more work.</p>

<h3 id="where-are-we-now">Where are we now</h3>

<p>The last couple of days were ideal to work in the space, a lot had to be done and a lot of help was received from participants and friends. As of now we can say, the floor is getting somewhere. One of our participants, Pim made load calculations of what the floor should, could and also could not handle. This resulted in some very nice pictures and a clear view of where to start.</p>

<p>On Friday Pim and Miep joined forces and started working on the frame to support our false floor. We had decided on creating a false floor because of the very cold concrete in our space. This would be very welcome in the summer, but it would also be way too cold in the winter to work on your projects. As you will see in the pictures, we covered almost 1/3th of the space with the frame.</p>

<p>David and Juerd continued working on the frames which were needed to create the walls upstairs. In the short amount of time, all the frames were fixed, Thanks Juerd!!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dennus had made a door for our closet. which looks like a nice piece of craftmanship. If you would ever need a door, just give a call. He might be in town to help you out!</p>

<p>As we can say after the last couple of days, the Pixelbar participants rock! much work is done, and we now know the rest of the work will also be done by creative, technical and driven people.</p>

<p>Today, 8Th of May, some of our participants are in the hackerspace again. If you want to help us building our( and maybe even your ) new hackerspace. You are very welcome! Just check our site, twitter or chat for the “Pixelbar is Open!” messages. Since last friday the spacestate is working correctly again!</p>

    <p>So, we can start each post with a standard “we’re back again” however we though it was a better idea to show you what we did so-far. On Kingsday 2016 we came together with some of our members to start working on the walls of the new hackerspace.</p>

<h3 id="our-agenda">Our Agenda</h3>

<p>We started the day getting some wood, After we brought the new materials back to the space we started working on a frame for one of the walls. At noon, we had finished our first wall frame. Later during the day we made another frame. At least it’s a start.</p>

<p><img src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13130854_567355333438862_8943574628870175768_o.jpg" width="350px" />

<h3 id="next-build-meetup">Next build meetup</h3>

<p>This weekend, on Saturday 30th of April we will be back at Pixelbar to continue our work. The additional wood has arrived and we are really looking forward to continue building Pixelbar!. If you are around, feel free to drop by. ( but note, we might ask you to help us ;) ).</p>

<h3 id="project-wifi">Project WiFi</h3>

<p>Together with Keilewerf, we thought of an central WiFi network infrastructure. The “old” WiFi network was only working in the central kitchen. Unfortunately the reach was not enough for all of the awesome neighbours we have at the Keilewerf. Dennus and Miep started working on the new WiFi environment on Kingsday. At the end of the evening everything worked! We had places 1 small rack as distribution and 5 Accesspoints were placed at this moment, 2 more are to be placed in Pixelbar itself. For complete awesomeness we have added 2 racks to our hackerspace ( which were sponsored by <a href="http://www.nifhack.nl">nifhack</a> ). We will distribute the network of our hackerspace centrally via these racks.</p>

<p><img src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/s960x960/13063050_567355376772191_7661748750779694234_o.jpg" width="350px" /></p>

When we have final dates for building the construction we will also send out an email to our mailinglist which you can join <a href="https://www.pixelbar.nl/joinlist/">here</a>.</p>
