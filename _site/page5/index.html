<p>The last couple of days we have used our time wisely! on Kingsday we were placing and creating walls and frames on the first floor, Then when we met again on wednesday we prepared some more and had an awesome (pixel-)barbeque, made more idea’s an thought of constructions. Thursday was a national holiday in the netherlands, because it was “bevrijdingsdag” or Liberation Day. Since we all had a day off from work we decided to do some more work.</p>

<h3 id="where-are-we-now">Where are we now</h3>

<p>The last couple of days were ideal to work in the space, a lot had to be done and a lot of help was received from participants and friends. As of now we can say, the floor is getting somewhere. One of our participants, Pim made load calculations of what the floor should, could and also could not handle. This resulted in some very nice pictures and a clear view of where to start.</p>

<p>On Friday Pim and Miep joined forces and started working on the frame to support our false floor. We had decided on creating a false floor because of the very cold concrete in our space. This would be very welcome in the summer, but it would also be way too cold in the winter to work on your projects. As you will see in the pictures, we covered almost 1/3th of the space with the frame.</p>

<p>David and Juerd continued working on the frames which were needed to create the walls upstairs. In the short amount of time, all the frames were fixed, Thanks Juerd!!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dennus had made a door for our closet. which looks like a nice piece of craftmanship. If you would ever need a door, just give a call. He might be in town to help you out!</p>

<p>As we can say after the last couple of days, the Pixelbar participants rock! much work is done, and we now know the rest of the work will also be done by creative, technical and driven people.</p>

<p>Today, 8Th of May, some of our participants are in the hackerspace again. If you want to help us building our( and maybe even your ) new hackerspace. You are very welcome! Just check our site, twitter or chat for the “Pixelbar is Open!” messages. Since last friday the spacestate is working correctly again!</p>

    <p>So, we can start each post with a standard “we’re back again” however we though it was a better idea to show you what we did so-far. On Kingsday 2016 we came together with some of our members to start working on the walls of the new hackerspace.</p>

<h3 id="our-agenda">Our Agenda</h3>

<p>We started the day getting some wood, After we brought the new materials back to the space we started working on a frame for one of the walls. At noon, we had finished our first wall frame. Later during the day we made another frame. At least it’s a start.</p>

<h3 id="project-wifi">Project WiFi</h3>

<p>Together with Keilewerf, we thought of an central WiFi network infrastructure. The “old” WiFi network was only working in the central kitchen. Unfortunately the reach was not enough for all of the awesome neighbours we have at the Keilewerf. Dennus and Miep started working on the new WiFi environment on Kingsday. At the end of the evening everything worked! We had places 1 small rack as distribution and 5 Accesspoints were placed at this moment, 2 more are to be placed in Pixelbar itself. For complete awesomeness we have added 2 racks to our hackerspace ( which were sponsored by <a href="http://www.nifhack.nl">nifhack</a> ). We will distribute the network of our hackerspace centrally via these racks.</p>

    <span class="post-date">05 Apr 2016</span>

    <p>Here we are again! Pixelbar, a hackerspace without a space. At least, for now. Since the opening where we announced the upcoming move of the physical location of the space we did a lot of work!</p>

<p>We had a pile of idea’s, lots of very enthousiastic participants and even more important a location within the Keilewerf where our new hackerspace would come. Since Februari we have made plans for the new hackerspace. Last week we took a major step forward, the mezzanine was finally placed. Now it’s far more visible what the size of the new Pixelbar space will be. We can tell you, we were very pleased with the result so far. Today we will be ordering the nescesarry build materials for the walls, When it arrives our awesome neighbour Sil will help us out with the construction of the walls.</p>

<h3 id="the-project">The project</h3>

<p>Since building your own hackerspace looks like a project we decided to start a wiki article on it which you can find <a href="https://wiki.pixelbar.nl/index.php/Projects:2016:New_Hackerspace">here</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to send us advice or, even more important help us building the new space. We are nowhere without help from our participants and our friends.

<h3 id="hackerhotel">Hackerhotel</h3>

<p>This was not all we have done, Five of our members also attended <a href="https://hackerhotel.nl">HackerHotel</a> last week, A hacker conference in the Netherlands. We even had a new participant register on the event. Apart from attending lots of interesting (tech) talks we also talked a lot about Pixelbar. We wanted to make sure the name would be in everyone’s head. Needless to say, it worked! Lots of participants from other hackerspace, students and other people were really interested in Pixelbar. We were even offered extra help on building the new hackerspace!</p>

    <p>The party last Saturday was awesome! Thank you all for visiting, the presents and many thanks to all the other hackerspaces for helping out! This has really kickstarted the current space. We’ve also received lots of ideas and input on how we could create and arrange everything in the new (upcoming) space.</p>

<p><a href="http://keilefest.nl">Keilefest</a> did a great job on the festival, with artists like <a href="http://wldrf.nl/">WLDRF</a> and the great food and beverages.</p>

<p>But most of all, thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/brenno">Brenno</a> for giving a presentation and explaining the world about hackerspaces (Dutch):</p>
