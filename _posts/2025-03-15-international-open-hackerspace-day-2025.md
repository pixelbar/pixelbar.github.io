title: International Open Hackerspace Day – Pixelbar!
---

It’s that time of the year again! On Saturday, March 29, hackerspaces around the world will open their doors, and of course, Pixelbar is joining in! 🚀

Ever wondered what happens inside a hackerspace? Do you think all hackers sit in the dark staring at screens filled with green code? Or are you just curious to see where Pixelbar is located?

A hackerspace is a community-driven playground where technology, creativity, and innovation come together. Whether you're into electronics, programming, 3D printing, laser cutting, DIY projects, or just love to do stuff with cool tech, this is the place to be!
But finding your way around might not always be straightforward… Keep an eye out for the white rabbits 🐇—they know the way!

During International Open Hackerspace Day, our members will be happy to:
- ✅ Show you around and introduce you to the world of hackerspaces
- ✅ Demonstrate awesome projects they've been working on
- ✅ Introduce you to our tools and equipment that you can use as a visitor
- ✅ Answer all your burning tech questions (yes, even “Is this USB stick safe to plug in?” 😉)
- ✅ Maybe even help with a project you bring along!

📍 Location: Pixelbar, Schiemond 20, 3024 EE, Rotterdam (inside De Kroon – just follow the white rabbits!)<br />
🕝 Open from 13:37 until 18:00 (stay as long as there are people around!)<br />
💸 Entrance is free, ring the intercom at the entrance of De Kroon and people will open up the door

Even after official hours, some members may still be around. Check the top of this website to see if we’re open. Can’t make it on March 29? No worries! Pixelbar is also open on Wednesdays and Saturdays—check our website for the latest schedule.

Curious? Follow the signs, follow the tech, but most of all, follow the white rabbits! 
🐇🔧✨ See you there!
