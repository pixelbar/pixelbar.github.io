title: 29 November Happy Sint Pannekoek!
---

The 29th of November it is a party once again! Just like last year, we will be celebrating Sint Pannekoek with everybody starting **at 19:00**, with lots and lots of pancakes and friends! Please give us a heads up if you like to join (so we can go grocerie shopping only once :)) on to our [Slack](https://slack.pixelbar.nl) or IRC.

Last year we baked pancakes for about 4 hours, Everyone really enjoyed eating pancakes and placing pancakes over their heads. Sounds strange doesn't it? Well, it's a very old Rotterdam tradition and we'd like to celebrate it by basically eating lots of pancakes. Yep. It's the best tradition there is. And nobody will ever change our tradition.
