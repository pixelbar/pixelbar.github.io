---

Are you interested in 3D printing? Whether you have yet to buy your first 3D printer or already have an entire print farm, the 3D Print & Pizza Meetup is the perfect opportunity to meet like-minded individuals and share your passion. Everyone with an interest in 3D printing is welcome!

**What to expect**
- **Show and Tell**: Have you printed something cool? Feel free to bring it along to show it off or maybe ask for feedback.
- **Troubleshooting**: Having problems with your 3D printer? Bring it along, and maybe others can help you solve the issue. Bringing something is not mandatory, but it often starts a good conversation.
- **Presentations and Workshops**: Want to give a presentation or organize a workshop? The meetup offers a platform for everyone to share knowledge. Discuss with the venue in advance if you need any extra equipment.

**Location**  
3D Print and Pizza Rotterdam is hosted at Hackerspace Pixelbar. We are at Schiemond 20, 3024 EE Rotterdam. This is inside "De Kroon", follow the signs for K14.

If you're coming with public transportation: you can go to Tram stop Schiemond or Metro Station Delfshaven and then walk towards the harbor.

To access the space you need to go up a set stairs, we sadly don‚Äôt have an elevator.

If you are bringing a large object we have a seperate entrance, ping one of the Pixelbar members.
