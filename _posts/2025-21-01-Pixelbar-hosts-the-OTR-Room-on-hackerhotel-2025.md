title: Pixelbar hosts the OTR (Off The Record) Room on Hackerhotel 2025
---

During Hacker Hotel, Pixelbar is hosting the Off The Record (OTR) Room in the meeting room Mozart. It’s a space where you can let your guard down and share stories that won’t leave the room. Think of it as an ‘Off-the-Record’ room filled with security/technology-related war stories, anecdotes, rants, discussions, and even Q&A sessions. Whether it’s thrilling zero-day adventures or experiences you won’t see on cameras or the internet – everything stays in the OTR Room.

The OTR Room is all about trust and sharing things you wouldn’t normally talk about. No cameras, no recordings. Just a safe place to tell your story or listen to others who have something unique to share.

Keep posted for announcements about what’s happening in the OTR Room throughout the weekend. There will be plenty of opportunities to participate, listen, and engage in exclusive discussions and activities.

Pixelbar is proud to host this room, and thanks to donations from HackZone and others in the hacker community, we can keep it open all weekend. Want to support us? We rely on donations to make this space possible, so every contribution helps!

Will we see you there?
