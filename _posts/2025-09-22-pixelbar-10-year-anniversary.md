# PIXELBAR 10 YEARS

In 2025, Pixelbar officially celebrates its **10th anniversary**!  
What started as a small group of enthusiasts with a shared passion for technology, creativity, and collaboration has grown into a vibrant hackerspace in Rotterdam over the past decade.

To mark this special milestone, we’re hosting a **barbecue and party** on **September 27, 2025** at our space.  
The evening will feature a community BBQ, music, a short speech by the board, and of course the chance to reconnect with members and friends of Pixelbar.

This anniversary is not only a moment to look back on ten years of projects, workshops, and community, but also to set the stage for the future.  
Pixelbar will continue to be the place where makers, hackers, and creatives come together to bring ideas to life.
