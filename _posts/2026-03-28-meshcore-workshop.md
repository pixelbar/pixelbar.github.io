Interessted in Meshcore?
It doesn't matter if you are new to this,
of if you have sent hundreds of messages already.
Everyone is welcome!


**What to expect**  
In this workshop, we're going to flash a meshcore companion device.  
And use it to send out our first messages.  

For the more advanced Meshcore users, 
we're go over how to manage a repeater,
and how to perform an 'over-the-air' update.  

**Preparations**  
It's not required to bring your own hardware, but if you want to fully participate, we recommend:
* A meshcore companion device, like a Heltec v3//v4, or a LilyGO T-Deck.
There will be a few SenseCAP Trackers available for people without a device.
* A laptop ( Windows / Mac / Linux) to flash the device.
* For more acvanced users, a meshcore repeater device, to practice an OTA update

At the end of the workshop, you'll be ready to send messages in the Meshcore community!

**Location**  
The Meshcore Workshop is hosted at Hackerspace Pixelbar. We are at Schiemond 20, 3024 EE Rotterdam. This is inside "De Kroon", follow the signs for K14.  
If you're coming with public transportation: you can go to Tram stop Schiemond or Metro Station Delfshaven and then walk towards the harbor.  
To access the space you need to go up a set stairs, we sadly don’t have an elevator.
